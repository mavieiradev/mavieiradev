## 🚀 About Me

Passionate **QA Automation Engineer** with a proven track record in building robust test frameworks and implementing efficient CI/CD pipelines. I transform manual processes into automated solutions, ensuring software quality while accelerating delivery cycles. My approach combines technical expertise with a deep understanding of user experience to deliver exceptional quality at scale.

- 🌱 Mastering **Playwright Architecture** and **Modern CI/CD Optimization Techniques**
- 👯 Looking to collaborate on **Open-source Testing Tools** or **AI-based Test Automation Solutions**
- 💬 Ask me about **Test Architecture Design**, **CI/CD Integration**, or **QA Process Optimization**
- ⚡ Fun fact: I automate mundane tasks even outside work – from home lighting schedules to personal finance tracking – because why click 100 times when a script can do it once?
